  <h2>The SSD/HDD </h2>
  <p>The Solid State Drive (SSD) and Hard Disk Drive (HDD) will act as primary storage units for your PC's data.
     The bare minimum you need for storage would just be an HDD, SSD's are seen as an luxury part. Yet, I would
     recommend that you have both: an HDD that will hold the bulk of information you want to save, and an SSD which will hold
     all of the programs that you will frequently use.

     <br><br>
     I have provided a table showing the pros and cons for having an SSD versus an HDD.
