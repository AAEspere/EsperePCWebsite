  <h2>The SSD/HDD </h2>
  <p>The Solid State Drive (SSD) and Hard Disk Drive (HDD) will act as primary storage units for your PC's data.
     The bare minimum you need for storage would just be an HDD, SSD's are seen as an luxury part. Yet, I would
     recommend that you have both: an HDD that will hold the bulk of information you want to save, and an SSD which will hold
     all of the programs that you will frequently use.

     <br><br>
     I have provided a table showing the pros and cons for having an SSD versus an HDD.

     <table>
       <tr>
         <td></td><td align = "center">Pros</td><td align = "center">Cons</td>
       </tr>
        <td>SSD</td>
        <td>- Faster run times. Computer will boot up in seconds.
          <br>
          - Less prone to data deletions, failures, etc.
          <br>
          - Less noisy than HDD.
        </td>
        <td>
          - More expensive per gigabyte of data to an HDD.
          <br>
          - Due to expenses, may not be suitable as primary storage.
       <tr>
         <td>HDD</td>
         <td> - Less expensive per gigabyte of data to an SSD.
           <br>
           - Greater base storage capacity
           <br>
           - More accessible in the market
         </td>
         <td> - Can be fragile, slight damage can delete data.
           <br>
           - Slower run times. Computer can take up to 20 seconds to boot up with one.
           <br>
           - Can get very noisy.
         </td>
       </tr>
     </table>
