  <h2>The Motherboard</h2>
      The motherboard acts as the hub for all your pc parts: it allows them to communicate with one another.
      Your motherboard will be fitted into your PC case, and all of the parts will be connected to it in some way.
      The CPU, cooler, RAM, and GPU will directly be connected to the motherboard.

      <br><br>
      From my perspective, a motherboard's price will increase with the amount of additional features it comes with.
      Some of these additional features can include USB 3.0, SATA III, SLI support, overclock support, and wifi capability.
      If on a budget, this is the part you can skimp out of if required. The bare minimum for a motherboard should be the
      one that has features that fit all of your required needs. Do you plan on overclocking? Do you plan on running two
      GPUs in SLI? Do you plan on running a certain type of RAM? How much RAM do you plan on installing? These are some of the
      questions you should be answering when looking for a motherboard.

      <br><br>
      There are only a few things to look out for when deciding on what motherboard to get. First, consider the case size of your PC.
      Make sure the motherboard you plan on buying will fit inside. Next, make sure the motherboard provides support for your
      chosen CPU. There are some motherboards that will require a software update in order to run with your chosen CPU. Make sure your motherboard
      will be compatible with your CPU out of the box, so you will not have to acquire another CPU in order just to update the motherboard. Finally,
      make sure you will be utilizing all the features of the motherboard you will be buying. There's no point in buying a $300 motherboard when you're
      not even utilizing all of its features. There isn't much of a difference in a $300 and $150 motherboard in performance, so if you don't require
      that much, you could go for the $150 one.
