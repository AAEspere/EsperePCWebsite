  <h2>The PSU</h2>
  <p>
    The Power Supply Unit (PSU) somewhat acts like the battery for the PC. The PSU takes the electricity from an outlet and supplies the parts of the
    PC with power. This is a very important part! It provides energy to all of your computer parts. So it is important to choose a quality one!

    <br><br>
    Choosing the correct PSU is very imporant. If your PSU cannot supply enough power for the wattage that all the components your PC requires, your PC
    will not only most likely not turn on, BUT the PSU has a possibility of frying many parts of your PC. A low quality PSU could potentially
    short-circuit and become a fire hazard. There are cases where a PC set on fire due to a low quality PSU, so I wouldn't skimp out on this part!

    <br><br>
    When choosing a PSU, you should determine how much wattage your system will require. Generally your CPU and GPU will require a lot of wattage, while
    the other parts do not require that much. You can calculate the wattage your system will require with websites like <a href = "https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator">
    Extreme Outer Vision's Power Supply Calculator</a> or <a href = "https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/"> Cooler Master's Power Supply Calculator</a>.
    These websites just require you to input the parts you plan on putting in your PC, and it will calculate the wattage your PC requires and give out a recommended
    PSU to buy.

    <br><br>
    Once you get the wattage your PC requires, you can choose a PSU! It is recommended that you get a PSU whose wattage is much higher than the wattage required for your PC.
    For example, if your system requires 475 watts, it is recommended to get a PSU with 600 watts or 700 watts. That way in any circumstances where your system uses more than
    its required wattage, you have some leeway for your PSU. I would recommend getting a PSU that is about 150 watts more than its required wattage (more if you plan on doing
    things like overclocking). There are quality grades for PSUS: bronze, silver, gold, platinum, etc. The grade is the assessment for the efficiency of a power supply.
    I would recommend the Gold quality: it is a quality PSU grade and isn't too expensive like the platinum+ PSUs.
