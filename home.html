    <!--Explanation of the purpose of the website-->
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to PC Parts Explained! I made this website for people who are interested in their first PC, but don't really
    know where to start. I'll be explaining in laymans terms the functionality of the part, and how it works with the
    whole PC. I will also providing my perspective on the individual part, like how important I think the part is,
    and how much you should be spending on it based on your budget! I will also give some sample builds.

<!--List that provides pictures of the PC parts which link internally to the other pages-->
  <br><br>I will be going over the following parts in detail:
  <br>
  (you can click on the parts to go to their respective pages)

<!--This table formats the images in a 2x3 table, where each respective cell holds
    the name of the part along with a picture of the part. The pictures are clickable
    links that bring the user to another page of the website-->
  <table id = "hometable">
    <tr>
      <td>
          <a href = "cpu.html"><img class = "homepicture" src = "img/CPUAMD.jpg"></a><br>
            <p>CPU</p>

  PLEASE NOTE: I will provide my perspective on each part of the PC, but that doesn't mean that you should be following
  my word to build your own PC! I want this website to serve as a hub of information for beginner PC builders to reference
  as they research parts for their PC. This website should be used to learn the basics of PC parts, I recommend you extend
  your knowledge of PCs by doing extended research!
