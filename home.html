    <!--Explanation of the purpose of the website-->
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to PC Parts Explained! I made this website for people who are interested in their first PC, but don't really
    know where to start. I'll be explaining in laymans terms the functionality of the part, and how it works with the
    whole PC. I will also providing my perspective on the individual part, like how important I think the part is,
    and how much you should be spending on it based on your budget! I will also give some sample builds.

<!--List that provides pictures of the PC parts which link internally to the other pages-->
  <br><br>I will be going over the following parts in detail:
  <ul>
    <li><a href = "cpu.html">The CPU</a></li>
    <li><a href = "motherboard.html">The Motherboard</a></li>
    <li><a href = "ram.html">The RAM</a></li>
    <li><a href = "gpu.html">The GPU</a></li>
    <li><a href = "sddhdd.html">The SDD and HDD</a></li>
    <li><a href = "psu.html">and the PSU </a></li>
  </ul>

<br>
  PLEASE NOTE: I will provide my perspective on each part of the PC, but that doesn't mean that you should be following
  my word to build your own PC! I want this website to serve as a hub of information for beginner PC builders to reference
  as they research parts for their PC. This website should be used to learn the basics of PC parts, I recommend you extend
  your knowledge of PCs by doing extended research!
