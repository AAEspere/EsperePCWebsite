  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to PC Parts Explained! This website is intended for people who are interested in building their first PC, but lack the technical knowledege to feel confident in doing so.
    I will be explaining in laymans terms the functionality of the part, and how it will affect the whole PC. I will also provide my perspective on the individual part: how important I
    deem a part and how much I recommend spending on it, current popular parts, and will give some sample builds!
  <br><br>I will be going over the following parts in detail:
  <ul>
    <li><a href = "cpu.html">CPU</a></li>
    <li><a href = "motherboard.html">Motherboard</a></li>
    <li><a href = "ram.html">RAM</a></li>
    <li><a href = "gpu.html">GPU</a></li>
    <li><a href = "sddhdd.html">SDD/HDD</a></li>
    <li><a href = "psu.html">PSU</a></li>
  </ul>
  PLEASE NOTE I will be providing my own perspective on each part of the PC, but that doesn't mean my word should be taken as law! I want this website to be a
  hub of information for beginner PC builders to reference, but this website should be used to learn the basics of PC parts. I recommend extending your knowledege
  of PCs by doing extended research!</p>
