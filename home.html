  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to PC Parts Explained! This website is for people who are interested in building a PC for the very first time,
  but lack the technical knowledge to feel confident in doing so.
  <br>I will be explaining in laymans terms to help describe the functionality of the part, and provide my own perspective on how
  much I think should be invested in such a part.
  <br>I will be going over the 8 parts mentioned in the navigation bar: the CPU, motherboard, RAM, GPU,
  SDD/HDD, and PSU! PLEASE NOTE that I will be providing my own perspective on the part, so my word shouldn't be taken as law!
  I just want to provide a helpful conglomerate of information for first time PC builders to keep looking over. Use this website to learn the
  basics of the PC parts, and then extend your knowledge by researching more in depth!</p>
