  <h2>The RAM</h2>
  <p>
    Random Access Memory (RAM) acts as short term data storage for your PC. It allows you to do the everyday tasks
    in your PC. If you're into gaming, RAM will allow for a sizable increase in frames per second. All programs in your
    PC will take some amount of memory, and the RAM will provide for it. With more RAM you will be able to do more
    tasks simultaneously without any slowdowns or crashes.

    <br><br>
    When choosing RAM, there are two things to consider: the speed of the RAM, and the amount of RAM. The amount of
    RAM in your system will provide the largest boost in performance. Usually more ram = better performance. A good
    amount of RAM is 8 gigabytes for casual use/light gaming. If you want to push higher graphics with more fps,
    I would recommend 16 gigabytes of RAM. Anything higher may be a little excessive, but up to your discretion.
    The speed of the RAM is something to consider also. The higher the speed, the higher performance of your RAM.
    If you are going for higher RAM speeds, you will have to set the speed in your BIOS.

    <br><br>
    There isn't a specifically recommended RAM to use, just look for model type, speed, and size. Make sure if you're buying
    multiple RAM sticks that they are consistent in RAM model and speed. A popular RAM model is the
    <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Vengeance-3000MHz-Desktop-Memory/dp/B0134EW7G8"> Corsair Vengence</a>, which
    usually comes in 8 Gigabytes per RAM stick.
