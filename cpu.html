  <h2>The CPU</h2>
  <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit), it a very important part as it acts as the brain of the PC.
    The CPU is integral to the PC, as it performs actions, runs programs, and constantly sends instructions to other parts of the PC.
    It is important to consider what you'll be doing with your PC when considering a CPU. You will want a CPU that can handle the tasks
    you plan on doing, as you may experience slowdowns and long wait times during use if your CPU is too weak.

  <br><br>
  For new buyers, there are three important things to look for in a CPU: the model series, processor speed, and the amount of cores. 

  Along with your CPU, you may possibly need a CPU Cooler if your CPU does not come with one. This is just attached on top
  of your CPU along with a fan that keeps the CPU cool as they can run extremely hot. One CPU Cooler I can recommended
  for large cases would be the <a href = "http://www.coolermaster.com/cooling/cpu-air-cooler/hyper-212-evo/">the Cooler Master
  Hyper 212 Evo</a>, a great budget cooler that usually runs around 30 dollars.

  When considering what kind of CPU you want in your own PC, you have to consider a term called bottlenecking.
  Bottlenecking happens when your GPUâ€™s (Graphics Processing Unit) performance is hindered by the capabilities of your CPU.
  This typically occurs when a computer build has a high-end GPU and a low-end CPU. To avoid bottlenecking, you should generally choose a CPU that is close in performance to

<h2>The Brands of CPU</h2>
<p>When considering a CPU, there a two large brands in CPU production: <b>Intel</b> and <b>AMD</b>. These two brands have controlled the market of CPUs for a very long time,
and will primarily be the ones availble for purchase at retail stores and online. It has been generally noted by the Internet that Intel CPUs are much more
powerful than AMD ones, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't consider an AMD CPU! I have provided a helpful table showing pros of both CPU brands.</p>
