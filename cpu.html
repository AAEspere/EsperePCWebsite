  <h2>The CPU</h2>
  <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit), it a very important part as it acts as the brain of the PC.
    The CPU is integral to the PC, as it performs actions, runs programs, and constantly sends instructions to other parts of the PC.
    It is important to consider what you'll be doing with your PC when considering a CPU. You will want a CPU that can handle the tasks
    you plan on doing, as you may experience slowdowns and long wait times during use if your CPU is too weak.

  <br><br>
  For new buyers, there are three important things to look for in a CPU: the model series, processor speed, and the amount of cores. All three of these features
  affect the efficiency of the CPU. Of course you should consider what you plan to do on your PC before choosing what model series, processor speed, and
  amount of cores you need. If you have too many cores and aren't effectively using all of them, you are wasting potential money. If your model series is
  too much for what you want to do, you are wasting potential money.

  Along with your CPU, you may possibly need a CPU Cooler if your CPU does not come with one. This is just attached on top
  of your CPU along with a fan that keeps the CPU cool as they can run extremely hot. One CPU Cooler I can recommended
  for large cases would be the <a href = "http://www.coolermaster.com/cooling/cpu-air-cooler/hyper-212-evo/">the Cooler Master
  Hyper 212 Evo</a>, a great budget cooler that usually runs around 30 dollars.

	<br><br>
  When considering what kind of CPU you want in your own PC, you have to consider a term called bottlenecking.
  Bottlenecking happens when your GPUâ€™s (Graphics Processing Unit) performance is hindered by the capabilities of your CPU.
  This typically occurs when a computer build has a high-end GPU and a low-end CPU. To avoid bottlenecking, you should generally choose a CPU that is close in performance to
  your GPU. An example: you shouldn't have a 2080 series GPU with an I3 series CPU. The CPU is going to limit the potential of the GPU. Bottlenecking could result in things
  like slowdowns, or in the case of gaming, you will not be able to get the optimal frames per second for your graphics card.

<h2>The Brands of CPU</h2>
<p>When considering a CPU, there a two large brands in CPU production: <b>Intel</b> and <b>AMD</b>. These two brands have controlled the market of CPUs for a very long time,
and will primarily be the ones availble for purchase at retail stores and online. It has been generally noted by the Internet that Intel CPUs are much more
powerful than AMD ones, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't consider an AMD CPU! I have provided a helpful table showing pros of both CPU brands.</p>
